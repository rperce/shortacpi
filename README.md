shortacpi
=========

Parse the output of acpi down to something simple.

apci is great at reading battery data but bad at putting in a statusbar.

To download shortacpi, run

    wget https://raw.github.com/rperce/shortacpi/master/shortacpi
    chmod a+x shortacpi
    
and then move it to somewhere in your PATH, e.g.

    sudo mv shortacpi /usr/local/bin/
    


shortacpi works from any command-line that can see your PATH, or if you have a window manager that lets you create custom widgets of some sort (I use awesomewm), it's perfectly suited to live in a statusbar.
